# Architecture
For me thoughts of "architecture" has been present in my mind for as long as I can remember. Maybe it's personality trait, but I wouldn't be surprised if it has something to do with how my father always created smart tools or workarounds for when he worked on cars, boats and houses. It was his hobby, but at times it was a sidle hustle that almost turned into a carrier. When I started working myself as a software developer the first thing I bought was a book about design patterns and things just progressed from there. 

When studying at a technical university I realised that what we were tought was not really math, physics, programming etc, but rather how to analyze, categorize and solve different types of problems. The key word here is "**types**" which relates to design patterns (try to find a pattern that matches the current problem you are trying to solve) and architecture in general.
